However, in practice, there are only *finitely* many floating point numbers between `0` and `1`. So the probability of producing a value of `0` is somewhere in the order of 1 in 10 quadrillion, it *is* possible. Software can process items in the order of millions or even billions per second, so hitting 1 in 10 quadrillion odds in real applications is certainly possible. But getting a value of `1` is guaranteed to be impossible from `.random()`.\n",

Unless you have your computer hooked up to a [Geiger-Müller counter](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/) or a [lava lamp](https://blog.cloudflare.com/lavarand-in-production-the-nitty-gritty-technical-details/), it is a predictable machine, albeit one running billions of operations per second.\n",

    "The way most computers generate random numbers is actually *pseudo random*. It starts with some *arbitrary* value called a *seed*, such as the number of nanoseconds that have passed since the last millisecond, and then uses a formula to generate values from this based on a non-predictable pattern. You cannot predict the next random number simply based on the current one, you would need to know the seed as well. In theory if you observed enough numbers you could work out the seed, but in practice computers can deal with numbers big enough to make this take longer than the lifespan of the universe. You can read more detail about randomness on [random.org](https://random.org/randomness/).\n",

In a literal sense this makes the actions “predictable”, but the sequence itself has no obvious pattern. This is extremely useful when you are trying to test code with randomness. If you've written an AI that is meant to act with an element of randomness, but it isn't working quite right, it's extremely useful to be able to get the same results every time you run the code so you can fix the bug. This is called *deterministic randomness*.\n",

But now every time you run the code, provided the seed is the same, you will get the same random number sequence, and therefore the same results – provided you use the random numbers the same way!\n",
