You will go to your favourite search engine, search for “round up Python”, and the results will tell you to use the module called `math`.\n",

The list of inbuilt functions is kept only to the most essential and commonly used – if for no other reason than it being annoying when there are lots of reserved words that you cannot use for your own variable and function names. But we can import the `math` module with a single line:"
