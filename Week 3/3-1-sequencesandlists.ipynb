Don't worry about the exact syntax right now, but you can even see this in the names of the types when we write Java code – which, requires us to declare the type of each variable:\n",

Sometimes this is useful – one of the common principles when developing good Python code is that it is better to “fail loudly”.

If it had caused an error instead the code would crash, but you would immediately know where the problem was.\n",
