    "\n",
    "Hopefully you can already start to think of modifications to make this useful in various situations. The `value` of each node does not need to only be integers, it could be arbitrary objects, provided they support `==` and `<` (or we could allow the user to provide a `key` function to define their value). Now notice that we might have objects in the tree that we want to retrieve based on a single value: e.g. a user's ID number. Rather than just returning `True` and `False` (membership), we could return the object itself. Hence we have an efficient way of searching for a user by their ID number to retrieve the rest of their details, for example.\n",

Effectively, we'd need to perform a single round of insertion sort every time we added an item into the list, which would be $O(n)$.

    "\n",
    "The meaning of “check” depends on application. It's common to demonstrate this traversal by calling `print` at each stage. Suppose we applied this to the example tree from before. Remember, at *each* node think: “left, print node, right”. Starting at the root, we go left, but then we get to a new node so we go left again. The first node to print will be the 1, because it cannot go any further left.\n",

    "\n",

    "If we have a collection of $n$ items to sort, then on average we'd expect each addition to the tree to be $O(\\log(n))$, meaning building the full tree is $O(n \\log(n))$. Traversing the tree is just $O(n)$, and since we ignore the lower growth terms in a sum (consecutive actions), building a binary search tree is actually a viable $O(n \\log(n))$ sorting algorithm. It is on average a very effective way of *keeping* a sorted structure, because each addition is just $O(\\log(n))$ rather than the $O(n)$ you'd expect if you tried to keep a list sorted with insertion sort.\n",

There are ways of creating [self-balancing binary search trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree) to try to avoid this.\n",

    "In-order traversal for sorting is the most useful method for traversing a binary search tree. But for other binary trees, pre-order (NLR) or post-order (LRN) can be useful.
