    "### Array Lists\n",
    "In this section we are going to create our own list data structures, starting with the array-backed list, sometimes simply called an array list. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we've mentioned countless times now, Python doesn't really support arrays. It actually has an inbuilt module called `array` which creates collections with a fixed data type. This one aspect of a traditional array, but Python `array` collections can still grow to accommodate any number of elements. This is the actually interesting part of the list data structure implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an array in other languages you are required to pick a data type. The fixed type is important because elements of arrays are stored in sequentially in memory, so we need to know how big each one is to access any element in $O(1)$ time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: if each element in an array is 4 bytes big (an `int` in Java or C++), and we know the memory location of the first element is $x$, we can find the memory location of the $n$th element by doing $x+4n$. Languages that support pointers usually adjust for the size of the type for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we store data types that can be variable size, like strings? The answer is that we can create an array of *objects*, which is really an array of *pointers*. Each pointer is a fixed size, and the memory that contains the object itself can be managed to be any size we like.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means, for my money, type is not what makes a list distinct from an array. The fact that a list can grow to accommodate any number of elements, however, is interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "If I asked you to make a list (which grows) which uses an array to store its elements, you'd probably come to the right idea quickly enough, so let's just get straight to it:"

    "Take a look at the code above – hopefully many of the concepts are clear from reading the implementation, though I will cover the highlights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the list creates an array with some initial capacity. Ten is a fine default but we allow this to be specified manually in case you know you're creating a massive list. We keep a pointer which tells us where to place the next item: it obviously starts at zero. The code above gives this pointer the name `_size` because it happens to also be the number of elements in the list; the underscore is there to hint it's for internal use (within the class) only, but does not actually prevent easy external access if we want to (like two underscores would).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time we add a new element we check if there is space, and if there isn't, we grow the array. This is probably the section which requires the most explanation. First of all, here we've decided to double in size each time. This will work decently, but different implementations use different growth factors, some are non-linear! Next is the important part: we create a new “array” of the new size, then copy all the elements across from the old one. There is no way to grow an array, we just have to allocate new memory, copy the contents, then free the old memory. In languages with arrays there would usually be a built in function like `memcpy` or `arraycopy` that could do the copying for us, but it's just a for loop anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as we hit the line `self.contents = new_contents`, the old array (actually a list) is no longer being referenced by any variable in our code. This means it will eventually be picked up by an automatic process called *garbage collection*. Every now and then Python will scan for objects with no references, and if it finds them, it will free their memory. We can play around with data structures in Python without worrying about things like memory leaks, while still understanding the underlying concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in learning more about how this bit actually works, I think you are ready to read about the [Python data model](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html), where this is all specified. Python is a specification (how things should work), which omits some implementation details. The implementation of Python we are using is called `CPython`, because some of the core code is written in C.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More List Features\n",
    "The array list class above is a very basic implementation. Most lists contain additional methods for convenience, such as `insert(element, index)` or `remove(index)`. In the case of the array list, these both have the same basic mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "To insert an item `element` into an array list at position `index`:\n",
    "* Check the array is big enough, grow if necessary\n",
    "* Starting at the last element in the list (at position `size-1`), work backwards moving each item one space to the right, until you get to `index`\n",
    "* Once you have moved the item at `index` one space to the right, replace it with `element`\n",
    "* Increase `size` by one\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Note: you might be able to think of a slight optimisation if you have to grow at the same time as inserting)*\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove an item at position `index`:\n",
    "* Starting at position `index` and moving forwards until you reach the `size`, move each item one space to the left (so the item at position `index` gets overwritten)\n",
    "* Decrease `size` by one\n",
    "\n",
    "***Exercise:*** implement both of these as methods in the ArrayList class, along with any others you might be interested in trying (e.g. `.find(element)`, `.sort()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complexity\n",
    "Try to work out the complexity of each of the following operations on an array list, going by the implementations given above:\n",
    "* Accessing an item (`get(index)`)\n",
    "* Appending an item (`add(element)`)\n",
    "* Inserting an item (`insert(element, index)`)\n",
    "* Removing an item (`remove(index)`)\n",

    "I'll reveal the answers further down the page!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iterators\n",

    "The way the `for` syntax works in Python is using an `iterator`. This is a particular design of object which only exists to churn out one object at a time from a collection, and indicate when they are done (if they are ever done – they could generate objects infinitely).\n",

    "### Linked Lists\n",
    "The array-backed list is broadly good enough to be used for most purposes, hence why Python uses it for the inbuilt list syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully you came up with some ideas for the complexities of the various operations. Here are the answers:\n",
    "* Accessing an item (`get(index)`) – $O(1)$, just accessing an array \n",
    "* Appending an item (`add(element)`) – $O(1)$ *most of the time* except when it needs to resize which is $O(n)$\n",
    "* Inserting an item (`insert(element, index)`) – $O(n)$, must go through each element to move\n",
    "* Removing an item (`remove(index)`) – $O(n)$, same as the above\n",
    "\n",
    "If we need to store something in a list then we obviously want to access it again, and in many use cases, we'll want to access it multiple times. So prioritising for this complexity seems reasonable, and the array list is the obvious choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are occasions where we need to add and remove items from a list a lot. Consider the example of the *queue*. In a previous week we asked you to try to implement a queue with an array by using pointers for the head and tail. A *linear queue* gets stuck if you remove and add items. A *circular queue* avoids this problem by having the queue “wrap around” the array. This works fine for a fixed size queue, but if you were to try to grow the array you'd be in for a headache.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter another form of list, the *linked list*.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./resources/linked_list.png\" width=600 />\n",

    "The arrows in this illustration represent *pointers* or *references*, each component is referencing the next element of memory. The list itself is not really a single *thing*. These four components might be in totally different regions of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of each component as an *object*, and indeed, this is how we'll achieve the effect in Python. We need to refer to this list somehow, which is done with a reference to the first object: it is traditional to call this the “head” of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the code below. The class itself does barely anything, it is just being used like a `struct` in other languages, to combine two pieces of data into one, which also enables us to use references (like pointers)."

    "The great thing about a double linked list is we can use it as a queue of unlimited size, by adding items to one end and removing them from the other, both with $O(1)$ complexity. This use case has a special name: a double-ended queue or *deque*.

    "***Activity:*** Worried about the storage requirements of the doubly linked list? Not unreasonable – you need to store two “links” for every actual element in the list. If the elements are small, that will be a big overhead. You can halve the overhead using a *XOR linked list*. Research this structure yourself online, you can [start here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_linked_list).\n",
