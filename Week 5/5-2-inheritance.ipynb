    "### Inheritance\n",
    "Let's continue the vehicle example from Engage. Suppose we are writing a program where it makes sense to model individual vehicle objects – we might be writing an open world video game where these vehicles will be rendered on screen, or we might be writing a stock system for a vehicle hire company where we want to closely keep track of each vehicles details before and after each rental (mileage, dents and scrapes, service history, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "All vehicles will share some properties in this system, but they will also have characteristics that are unique to each specific type of vehicle. So we might want to create an attribute like `mileage` which will apply to all vehicles, but `number_of_doors` should only be on cars (and let's say a “car” includes any 4-wheeled vehicle on the road).\n",
    "\n",
    "We could create a Vehicle class that contains both attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table style=\"border:1px solid black\">\n",
    "<tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid black\"><th style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\">\n",
    "<p>Vehicle</p>\n",
    "</th></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td style=\"background-color:#F5F5F5\">\n",
    "<p>mileage<br>number_of_doors</p>\n",
    "</td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "But now any objects for motorbikes will have a wasted attribute. We could set `number_of_doors` to zero, but it's wasteful information, since we are assuming this is true for all motorbikes. The point of an attribute is that it can be different for each object: this car has 2 doors, this car has 5 doors, this car has 18 doors, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "So maybe we should create a class for each of them instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "<tr><td style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;vertical-align:top\">\n",

    "### Exercise\n",
    "#### Finding Inheritance\n",
    "Go back to the second exercise in section 5.1, and look at your class design. Can you see any relationships between classes that can be modelled with inheritance? Remember: inheritance implies an “is a” relationship. So if you have classes for both Lecturer and Staff, you might notice that “a lecturer *is a* (member of) staff”, and so Lecturer can be a subclass of Staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does doing this allow you to simplify your design, perhaps by removing duplication?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aggregation and Composition\n",
    "You might notice some relationships between classes that do not classify as inheritance, some may even seem like “is a” relationships. For example, consider classes called Assignment and Exercise. Maybe in your system every assignment *is a* collection of exercises, but hopefully it is clear that Assignment is not a subclass of Exercise; an assignment is not a type of exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship is called *composition*. The assignment is *composed of* several exercises. If the assignment does not exist, then neither do the exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a closely related relationship called *aggregation*. A student *has a* number of classes – if the student leaves the university, the classes continue to exist independently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spotting these kinds of relationships in your object-oriented design can also be really useful, but these concepts do not have direct language support (at least not in Python). These are design issues rather than strictly programming ones, but they are important to bring up if only to distinguish them from inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you spot any composition and aggregation in your class structure? You might like to consider drawing a *UML class diagram*, like the ones further up this page. This is a tool that can be used to formally model the design of a system, but can also be used more informally simply to help structure your thoughts. You can read more on [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram), including a more detailed description of [composition and aggregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram#Instance-level_relationships), along with many other relationships, and how to draw all of these on a diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's Next?\n",
    "Object oriented programming is fundamental to how a lot of people structure their code, and even their thoughts, when they try to approach a new problem. Once you get into the habit of designing class structures using inheritance and powerful features like polymorphism it can provide a really useful conceptual framework. A few other concepts come up when designing this way, which we'll see in the next section.\n",

    "### Style Footnote: Public or Private Attributes?\n",
    "In the previous section we wrote `self.__contents` to create a *private* attribute that was not accessible from outside the class. In the examples above, we did not use the underscores, so the “raw” attributes are accessible. Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no one correct answer. One of the principles of OOP is *encapsulation* – the idea that the class alone is responsible for its own data. If you come from a background using languages like Java you will be used to this idea: we make all of our attributes private, then we make public *accessor* and *mutator* methods (also called *getters* and *setters*) if we want others to have that level of access. If we ever need to change how those private attributes work, or want to enforce some validation, we can do so in the access methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can follow this style, no problem. But Python, as mentioned before, is built on principles of keeping things simple. The truly *Pythonic* way is to use plain public attributes. If we ever want to change the behaviour later, we can do so with *properties*. This all getting a bit too much for this section, but if you are interested, there is a [good article here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/property-getters-setters).\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, I recommend using public attributes, and you can read about properties later. But the important thing is to stay consistent throughout your code."
