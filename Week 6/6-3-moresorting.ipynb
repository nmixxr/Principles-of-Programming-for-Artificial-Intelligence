    "### Comparing Objects\n",
    "Remember in the last section we mentioned the fact that our implementation of selection sort was *unstable* – for objects with equal value they are not guaranteed to remain in the same order. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this selection we'll introduce *insertion sort*, which has a stable implementation. But first, the issue of stability highlights the fact that there can be more to an object than just a simple value. This makes sense if we think about it within the object oriented programming framework – objects have many attributes and methods, for any two given objects it might not be obvious how to *order* them. In fact, it might not even be obvious whether two objects are even *equal*!\n",

    "Then you take the next element from the list (the item at position `k` in the list, assuming zero-indexing – so the item directly after your sorted sub-list) and you store this item in a temporary variable. Now you go backwards through the array, checking the item at position `i = k-1`, `k-2`, `k-3`, and so on. Each time, you compare the item to the temporary variable: if it is less than or equal, you stop and insert the temporary variable value into position `i+1`. If the item is bigger, you move it one item to the right in the array, and continue moving down.\n",

The average case is better, but that inner for loop still scales with the length of the list, and we get the same quadratic complexity class.\n",
